### Overview

Open Horizon is a middleware solution designed to manage the deployment and service software lifecycle of containerized applications. It also supports an optional separation of concerns between a service and related machine learning assets by providing a separate model sync service.  These solutions enable autonomous management of large fleets of edge compute nodes in various connected states.

To install a simple, developer-friendly version of [all the services on one device](https://github.com/open-horizon/devops/tree/master/mgmt-hub), run the following one-liner as `root` on an x86_64 machine running Ubuntu 18.04:

{% capture code %}curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-horizon/devops/master/mgmt-hub/deploy-mgmt-hub.sh | bash{% endcapture %}
{% include code_snippet.md code=code language='shell' %}
