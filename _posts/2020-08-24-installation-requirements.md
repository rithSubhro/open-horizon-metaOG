# What are the installation requirements for Open Horizon?

Open Horizon has two main components: the management hub and the agent. The [all-in-one installation](https://github.com/open-horizon/devops/tree/master/mgmt-hub) supports installing both of them in a single VM or standalone bare metal computer.

The requirements for installing Open Horizon are:

* Architecture: management hub services - x86_64 (amd64)
* Memory: 4GB
* Storage: 20GB
* OS: management hub services - Ubuntu xenial or bionic, server or desktop

You may use a virtual machine (VM) to install on a host computer, as shown on the [quick start installation](https://open-horizon.github.io/common-requests/install.html) page.
