# Conventions used in this document
{: #document_conventions}

This document uses content conventions to convey specific meaning.  

## Command conventions

Replace the variable content that is shown in < > with values specific to your needs. Do not include  < > characters in the command.

### Example

  ```
  hzn key create "<companyname>" "<youremailaddress>"
  ```
  {: codeblock}
   
## Literal strings

Content that you see on the management hub or in code is a literal string. This content is shown as **bold** text.
   
 ### Example
   
 If you examine the `service.sh` code, you see that it uses these, and other configuration variables to control its behavior. **PUBLISH** controls if the code attempts to send messages to IBM Event Streams. **MOCK** controls if service.sh attempts to contact the REST APIs and its dependent services (cpu and gps) or if `service.sh` creates fake data.
