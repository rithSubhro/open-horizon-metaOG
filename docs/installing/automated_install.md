# Automated agent installation and registration
{: #method_one}

Note: These steps are the same for all edge device types (architectures).

1. If you have not already performed the steps in [Prepare for setting up edge nodes](../hub/prepare_for_edge_nodes.md), do that now. This process creates an API key, locates some files, and gathers environment variable values that are needed when you are setting up edge nodes.

2. Log in to your edge device and set the same environment variables that you obtained in step 1:

  ```bash
  exportÂ HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH=iamapikey:<api-key>
  export HZN_ORG_ID=<your-exchange-organization>
  export HZN_FSS_CSSURL=https://<ieam-management-hub-ingress>/edge-css/
  ```
  {: codeblock}

3. Copy the **agent-install.sh** script to your new edge device.

4. Run **agent-install.sh** to get the necessary files from CSS (Cloud Sync Service), install and configure the {{site.data.keyword.horizon}} agent, and register your edge device to run the helloworld sample edge service:

  ```bash
  sudo -s ./agent-install.sh -i 'css:' -p IBM/pattern-ibm.helloworld -w '*' -T 120
  ```
  {: codeblock}

  To see all available **agent-install.sh** flag descriptions run: **./agent-install.sh -h**

5. View the helloworld output:

  ```bash
  hzn service log -f ibm.helloworld
  # Press Ctrl-c to stop the output display
  ```
  {: codeblock}

6. If the helloworld edge service does not start, run this command to see error messages:

  ```bash
  hzn eventlog list -f
  # Press Ctrl-c to stop the output display
  ```
  {: codeblock}

7. (optional) Use the **hzn** command on this edge node to view services, patterns, and deployment policies in the {{site.data.keyword.horizon}} Exchange. Set your specific information as environment variables in your shell and run these commands:

  ```bash
  eval export $(cat agent-install.cfg)
  hzn exchange service list IBM/
  hzn exchange pattern list IBM/
  hzn exchange deployment listpolicy
  ```
  {: codeblock}

8. Explore all of the **hzn** command flags and subcommands:

  ```bash
  hzn --help
  ```
  {: codeblock}

## What's next

* Use the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} console to view your edge nodes (devices), services, patterns, and policies. For more information, see [Using the management console](../console/accessing_ui.md).
* Explore and run another edge service example. For more information, see [CPU usage to IBM Event Streams](../using_edge_services/cpu_load_example.md).
