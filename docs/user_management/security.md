{{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.ieam}}), based on [Open Horizon ](https://github.com/open-horizon){:target="_blank"}{: .externalLink}, uses several security technologies to ensure that it is secure against attacks and safeguards privacy. For more information about {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} security and roles, see:

* [Security and privacy](security_privacy.md)
* [Role-based access control](rbac.md)

For more information about creating workload signing keys if you do not already have your own RSA keys, see [Preparing to create an edge service](../developing/service_containers.md). Use these keys to sign services when you publish them to the exchange and enable the {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} agent to verify that it started a valid workload.
