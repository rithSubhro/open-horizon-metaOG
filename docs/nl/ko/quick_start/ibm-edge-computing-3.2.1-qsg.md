This guide provides a quick and easy way to get up and running with the product.

## Product overview
{: #prod_over}

Edge computing drives applications, data and computing power services away from centralized points and towards places that are closer to the user. This data is processed by a device or by a local computer or server instead of being transmitted to a data center.

IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices is designed specifically for edge node management to minimize the risks that are inherent in the deployment of global, or local, edge nodes. IBM Edge Computing Manager for Devices is also designed for managing the service software lifecycle on edge nodes fully autonomously.

IBM Edge Computing manager for Servers provides you with edge computing features to help you manage and deploy workloads from a management hub cluster to remote instances of {{site.data.keyword.open_shift_cp}} or other Kubernetes-based clusters.
