# Hello world
{: #policy}

{{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.ieam}}) uses policies to establish and manage service and model deployments, which give administrators the flexibility and scalability that is needed to work with large numbers of edge nodes. {{site.data.keyword.ieam}} policy is an alternative to deployment patterns. It provides a greater separation of concerns, allowing edge nodes owners, service code developers, and business owners to independently articulate policies.

This is a minimal "Hello, world" example to introduce you to {{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} deployment policies.

Types of Horizon policies:

* Node policy (provided at registration by the node owner)
* Service policy (can be applied to a published service in the Exchange)
* Deployment policy (also sometimes referred to as business policy, which approximately corresponds to a deployment pattern)

Policies provide more control over defining agreements between Horizon Agents on Edge Nodes and the Horizon AgBots.
